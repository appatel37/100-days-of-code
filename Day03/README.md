# Day 3 - Treasure Island
This is my third project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp.

## Description
A text-based adventure game where the player goes on a quest to find hidden treasure.  
The game uses conditional logic (`if/else`) to guide the player through different choices and story paths, ultimately leading to either finding the treasure or facing game over.

## Features
- Interactive text-based adventure.
- Multiple choices that affect the outcome.
- Uses nested `if/else` statements for decision-making.
- Fun story-driven gameplay.
- Runs directly in the terminal.

## What I Learned
- Writing and nesting `if/else` statements.
- Handling multiple conditions to create branching storylines.
- Using logical operators for complex decision-making.
- Improving code readability with indentation and structure.
- Creating a simple game loop with clear outcomes.
