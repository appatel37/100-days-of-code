# Day 16 - Coffee Machine Project

## What I Learned

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
- Creating and using classes and objects.
- Understanding how to divide large programs into multiple files.
- Using methods and attributes effectively.
- Building cleaner, modular, and maintainable code.

## Project - Coffee Machine

- This project simulates a coffee machine that can make espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- It checks resources, processes coins, and prepares coffee using multiple classes that interact with each other.

## How It Works

- The user selects a drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
- The program checks if there are enough ingredients.
- It processes the inserted coins and checks for sufficient payment.
- The drink is made and resources are updated.
- Typing report shows available resources and profit.
- Typing off stops the machine.

## Key Takeaways

- Learned the fundamentals of OOP and modular programming.
- Practiced using multiple Python files together.
- Understood how to manage resources and handle user input logically.
- Structured the project for scalability and clean code design.
