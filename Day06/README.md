# Day 6 - Python Functions & Karel 

## Project Overview
Day 6 focused on learning how to create and use **functions in Python**.  
Instead of building a project, today was about practicing with **Reeborg’s World** (an online robot maze game) to understand how functions work and why they are useful.

## What I Learned
- Defining functions in Python using `def`.  
- How to call a function multiple times.  
- Breaking down problems into smaller steps (decomposition).  
- Practicing with Reeborg’s World challenges to apply these concepts.

## Notes
- No standalone coding project today.  
- This day was mainly **conceptual learning** with exercises.  
- Understanding functions is a foundation for upcoming projects.
