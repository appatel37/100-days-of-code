# Day 4 - Rock Paper Scissors
This is my fourth project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp.

## Description
A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  
The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice.  
The program then compares both choices and declares the winner.

## Features
- Accepts user input (`0` for Rock, `1` for Paper, `2` for Scissors).
- Displays ASCII art for each choice.
- Computer randomly selects its move.
- Compares choices and decides the outcome (win, lose, or draw).
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## What I Learned
- How to use the `random` module to generate computer moves.
- Working with **lists** to store ASCII art and choices.
- Improved **if/elif logic** to determine game outcomes.
- Handling **user input validation** for a better user experience.
- Using modular arithmetic to simplify game rules.
