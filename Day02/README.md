# Day 2 - Tip Calculator
This is my second project from the 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp.

## Description
A beginner-friendly Python project that helps split a restaurant bill fairly.  
The program takes the total bill, the tip percentage, and the number of people, then calculates how much each person should pay.

## Features
- Accepts user input for bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people.
- Performs type conversion to handle numbers correctly.
- Calculates each personâ€™s share including the tip.
- Rounds the final amount to 2 decimal places for easy readability.
- Runs directly in the terminal.

## What I Learned
- Using the `input()` function to collect user data.
- Converting strings to integers/floats for calculations.
- Performing arithmetic operations in Python.
- Formatting outputs with f-strings.
- Rounding numbers for clean results.
