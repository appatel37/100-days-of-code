# Day 5 - Password Generator 🔐

## Project Overview
On Day 5, I created a **Password Generator** using Python.  
The program asks the user how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** they want in their password, then generates one accordingly.  

It first builds a list of characters, shuffles them for randomness, and finally joins them into a secure password.

## What I Learned
- Using **lists** to store letters, numbers, and symbols.
- The `random` module:  
  - `random.choice()` → pick random items.  
  - `random.shuffle()` → randomize order.  
- How to **append to lists** with `.append()`.
- Looping with `for` and `range()`.
- Combining list items into a string.
