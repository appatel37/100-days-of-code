## Project: Higher Lower Game
A simple text-based game where you compare two random public figures or entities and guess who has more followers.

### Game Rules
1. You’re shown two options: A and B.
2. You guess who has more followers.
3. If correct, your score increases and B becomes the next A.
4. The game continues until you guess wrong.
5. The final score is displayed at the end.
