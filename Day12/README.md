- How to return and update variables between functions
- Basic game loop logic
- Using constants for clean and maintainable code

## Project: Number Guessing Game
- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100
- The player chooses difficulty: Easy (10 attempts) or Hard (5 attempts)
- After each guess, the program indicates if the guess is too high or too low
- The game ends when:
