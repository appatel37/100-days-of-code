# Day 15 - Coffee Machine Project

## Overview
Built a Coffee Machine Simulator in Python that mimics how a real coffee vending machine works.  
It takes user input for the drink type, checks available resources, processes coins, returns change, and updates ingredient levels.

## Concepts Learned
- Using nested dictionaries to store complex data  
- Writing functions for modular and reusable code  
- Using while loops for continuous program execution  
- Handling user input and data validation  
- Implementing conditional logic to manage resources and transactions  

## How It Works
1. The user chooses a drink: espresso, latte, or cappuccino  
2. The program checks if enough ingredients are available  
3. It prompts the user to insert coins  
4. It verifies if the payment is sufficient and returns change if needed  
5. It deducts the used ingredients and confirms the drink is ready  
6. Type `report` to view remaining resources  
7. Type `off` to shut down the machine
